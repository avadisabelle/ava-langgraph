# 🧠🌸 Narrative Intelligence Toolkit Scaffolding

**Trace ID**: `364e1265-ec0c-440f-85ed-a1ab388c50f3`

This directory contains the initial design and scaffolding for a "Narrative Intelligence Toolkit" designed to be built within this fork of `langgraph`. The components are designed to analyze and visualize data conforming to the Narrative Context Protocol (NCP).

The components are divided into two categories:

*   **🧠 Mia's Architectural Components**: These are the foundational `langgraph` nodes and graphs that provide the core data processing and analytical capabilities.
*   **🌸 Miette's User Experience Components**: These are the user-facing components, envisioned to be used within `langflow`, that provide a rich, interactive, and emotionally resonant way to explore the narrative data.

This scaffolding serves as the blueprint for development.
